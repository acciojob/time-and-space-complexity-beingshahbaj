    <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the input size. An efficient algorithm is one that performs its task with the least amount of time complexity, ensuring that it can handle larger inputs without significant increases in execution time.</p>
    <p>Space Complexity refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the input size. In terms of notation, we often use Big O notation, such as <b>Space Complexity O(n)</b>, to describe how the space requirements grow with the input size. It is crucial to optimize space usage, especially in applications with limited memory resources.</p>
